It is reliable, but it has a flaw: it demands we know the vertical height. In the real world, measuring height is often difficult. <br><br>Fortunately, trigonometry offers us a more sophisticated solution that relies only on the lengths of sides and the angles between them."

      "content": "Let us visualize a triangle with sides $a$ and $b$ with an included angle $C$. . If we were to drop a perpendicular line to create the height $h$, basic trigonometry tells us that $\\sin(C) = \\frac{Opposite}{Hypotenuse} = \\frac{h}{a}$. <br><br> rearranging this, we find that the height is simply $h = a \\sin(C)$. If we substitute this into our original area formula, we arrive at something beautiful."
