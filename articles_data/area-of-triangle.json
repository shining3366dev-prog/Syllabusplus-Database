      "content": "You probably already know the classic formula for the area of a triangle: $Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. This works great—but only if you know the vertical height! <br><br>In the real world, measuring the straight-up height is often annoying or impossible. The <b>Sine Rule for Area</b> is a powerful shortcut that lets you calculate the area using just two sides and an angle, without needing to measure the height at all."

      "content": "Imagine a triangle with sides $a$ and $b$ and an angle $C$ between them. If we wanted to use the old method, we would need the height. By using basic trigonometry (SOH CAH TOA), we can figure out that the height is actually equal to side $a$ multiplied by $\\sin(C)$. <br><br>When we swap this into the old formula, we get a new, much faster equation."

      "content": "There is one very important rule: You must use the <b>Included Angle</b>. This means the angle you use must be sandwiched directly between the two sides you know. <br><br>Think of the two sides like the blades of a pair of scissors—the angle is the pivot point connecting them. This is often called the <b>Side-Angle-Side (SAS)</b> condition."
